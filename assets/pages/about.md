# About me

Hi! I'm Julia, but online, I typically go by the pseudonym `sylkos`. I'm currently a student at **Northeastern University** studying **Computer Science** and **Computer Engineering** with **Math** minor. I'm currently interested in embedded development, space, esoteric linux *things* and so much more. Honestly, I just like solving interesting problems and understanding how everything works, which tends to take me down many never-ending rabbit holes. I also enjoy skiing, biking, and reading, and cooking in my free time.

Currently, I'm doing a coop as an embedded R&D engineer at a metal 3d printing startup.
