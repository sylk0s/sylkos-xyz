Welcome to my website! I've wanted to make a website for a while, and finally had a break from schoolwork that was long enough to finish this project!


# Overview
This site is written using the Dioxus crate in Rust! I chose it mostly as a recommendation from a friend, but have definitely enjoyed developing using it. Partway through my progress on the site, Dioxus 0.5 was released, which was relatively easy to port my code base over to, and had quite a few small quality of life changes that cleaned up some of my code base significantly (not to mention the complete rewrite of the library itself).


To host this page, I'm using github pages. Someday I'd love to host on my own server, but for now this will do until I have some more premenate setup. After some struggling, I decided to actually read the docs for Dioxus on hosting a github pages site (I was unable to find this before), and was successful pretty quickly.


# Inspiration


I spent a... lot of time clicking around the internet looking for inspiration. Mostly by clicking through the 88x31 links at the bottom of many people's portfolios.


> Interesting tangent... through this whole process I was thinking about how I was basically just running a graph traversal algorithm over all the websites linked together this way. Interestingly enough, when I was searching for my blog a few months later, I came across this article discussing exactly this! The authors of this article put together a scraper to map out this network. [Here's a link](https://breq.dev/projects/eightyeightthirtyone) if you also think this is neat.


Anyways, here's some other people I drew inspiration from:


## [aura](https://auravoid.dev/)


I got lots of original inspiration from here. As is pretty evident, my home page is Very inspired by their website. I also reused the library they generated their stars from, with some modifications for theming and behavior.


## [mae](https://mae.wtf/)


I honestly can't point to one thing here. I really like how this looks and it definitely influenced how I tried to make my site look.


## [matdoesdev](https://matdoes.dev/blog)


This one was mostly the blog. Everytime I hit a wall in coding wondering "what does a blog even have in it" I would look here. I liked the simplicity of it, and hoped to emulate that in mine.


## [maia](https://maia.crimew.gay/)


For the most part, I'm including this because I think this is the one that started it all. I got a number of random ideas from here. Also just general inspiration for my projects.


## [MixedMatched](https://github.com/MixedMatched/website)


A friend, who inspired the markdown blog pages. Specifically, her code showed me how to turn a markdown file into the content my website serves.


# Future Plans


As of right now, I'm happy enough to put this website back on the backburner. It's presentable to the people and I'm pretty proud of it so far! Regardless of this, I always have more ideas for everything... here are a few:


- Create more blog posts
- Random easter eggs sprinkled around
- Better blog formatting
- Advanced tags, searching, and series support for the blog
- RSS Feed
- Better navigation in general




Anyways, Enjoy the website!
