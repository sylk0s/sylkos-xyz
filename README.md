# My Website!

This is the code for my website, built using the Dioxus crate in Rust, and deployed on github pages. To see the deployment, go [here](https://sylkos.xyz)!

I wanted to list a few places I got inspiration from since I spent a lot of time clicking around the internet to get ideas:
- [aura](https://auravoid.dev/) (Original inspiration for the stars)
- [mae](https://mae.wtf/) (General design ideas & content)
- [matdoesdev](https://matdoes.dev/blog) (Blog)
- [maia](https://maia.crimew.gay/) (Vibes)
- [MixedMatched](https://github.com/MixedMatched/website) (Blog, specifically the markdown conversion in rust)

Future Plans:
- Add to the blog (writing)
- Random Easter Eggs
- More advanced tag and search features for the blog
- Better navigation
