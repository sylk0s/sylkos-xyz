# About Page

Hey there!

My name is Julia Keadey, but I typically go by the pseudonym `sylkos` (often spelled `sylk0s` if the latter is taken) in most parts of the internet.

## Education

I'm currently a student at **Northeastern University** studying **Computer Science** and **Computer Engineering** with a minor in **Mathematics**, and planning to graduate in 2026. For more info, see my [Resume]

## Interests

Over the years, I've accumulated a Lot of random interests: robotics, space, programming, mathematics, physics, reading (especially fantasy and sci-fi, but also a good number of non-fiction books as well), hiking/being outdoors in general, traveling, public transit, climbing, skiing, electronics, music (both creating and listening to it), cooking, cybersecurity, The Internet as a whole, and so much more.

## Programming

In my free time, I like to write a lot of code! The first language I learned was Java, but recently, I do most projects that I can in Rust, since I generally enjoy how the language is designed. I also have worked with C, Python, Racket, JavaScript, CSS, Bash, Julia, and MATLAB (among many other things I'm probably forgetting about). I usually find myself designing projects for linux and homelab related uses, since one of my main hobbies recently has been running and maintaining linux on basically all my systems. I also tend to find that many of my projects have been related to minecraft, since that was the main thing that cemented my interest in programming over other fields.

## Linux

Picture this: 2021, Covid, 3:00 am. This was when I first installed arch linux. After getting fed up with windows when trying to make more complex automation and better hackability, I decided to finally install linux on my main PC after considering for years. I've never gone back... Now I run some flavor of linux on basically every device I own and have been working for years to perfect my setup. For over a year now, I've been switched from arch to NixOS on my main machines, which addressed a few issues I was having (I plan to make this a blog post at some point). I also run a debian server which may be swapping to NixOS sometime in the forseeable future.

## Minecraft

I've been a part of the technical minecraft community since around 2020 (wow, so long ago). Currently, I am a member of Quacon, where I do a number of server administration things mostly for our debian box, and play occasionally when I find the time (which seems to be less and less recently :\ ). For the most part, I've focused on developing TNT related technology, such as incredibly percise and increasingly complex cannons. I also helped found the TNT archive on discord, where people can come to learn more about the technology we have created. In the past, I have also been a member of both the Hekate and Melontech servers.
